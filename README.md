LGM MAZER
==========


This is a visual maze generator using 
Python generators. 

The current version maybe a nice example
of how to use the `yield` keyword for a co-routine.
The original code was written in 2010, 
at the Libre Grapics Meeting Brussels
auditoriun, much earlier than the 
introduction of special syntax
for co-routines in Python 3.5


future
=======

The current code uses Pygame as a graphics-backend,
the project revival in 2019 aim to add a 
text backend using the "terminedia" library.
